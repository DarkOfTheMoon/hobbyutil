To install:

    Unzip the chain.zip package somewhere.  The sig.py and
    getnumber.py scripts can be copied to a directory somewhere in
    your PYTHONPATH.  

    Or, if you wish, just leave everything in the same directory.

To run:

    Run the script as
        
        python chain.py

    and answer the relevant questions.

Read the chain.pdf file for some documentation and comments on chain
drilling.
