'''
Provides a function GetNumber that continues to prompts the user for a
number until an acceptable number is gotten.  The number can contain
an optional physical unit string if desired.

Also provides a function ParseUnit(s) for getting and returning a
number and its physical unit.

    '''General-purpose routine to get a number (integer or float
    [default]) from the user with the prompt msg:
 
        num_float = GetNumber(prompt_msg)
        num_int   = GetNumber(prompt_msg, numtype=int)
   
    If you wish to restrict the allowed values of the number, use the
    following keyword arguments (default values are in square
    brackets):
 
        numtype     Number type [float].  Use int if you want the 
                    number to be an integer.  You can use a number
                    class as long as it obeys the required ordering
                    semantics and the constructor returns a number
                    object that raises a ValueError if the
                    initializing string is of improper form.  For an
                    example, see the use of mpmath's mpf numbers in
                    the unit tests.
 
        default     Default value.  This value will be returned if 
                    the user just presses the return key when prompted.
 
        low         Lowest allowed value.  [None]
 
        high        Highest allowed value.  [None]
 
        low_open    Boolean; if True, then the low end of the acceptance
                    interval is open.  [False]
 
        high_open   Boolean; if True, then the high end of the acceptance
                    interval is open.  [False]
 
        invert      If true, the value must be in the complement interval.
                    This is used to allow numbers except those in a
                    particular range.  See note below.
 
        outstream   Stream to print messages to.  [stdout]
 
        instream    Stream to get input from (intended for unit tests).
 
        prefix      Prefix string for error messages 
                        ["Error:  must have "]
        
        use_unit    If true, allows a unit to be included in the string.
                    The return value will be a tuple of (number,
                    unit_string).  [False]
 
        allow_quit  If true, "Q" or "q" quits the program.  [True]
 
        inspect     If not None, it's a string that should be
                    inspected to see if it meets the requirements.  If
                    it does, True will be returned; otherwise, False
                    is returned.

        vars        Dictionary to use as locals to evaluate
                    expressions.
 
    For programming ease, any errors in the keyword values will cause a
    SyntaxError exception.  Other exceptions are likely because of my
    programming mistakes.
 
    Note:  if you call
 
        GetNumber("", low=a, high=b)
 
    the number returned will be the number in the closed interval [a, b].
    If you make the same call but with invert set to True
 
        GetNumber("", low=a, high=b, invert=True)
 
    then the returned number must lie in the union of the open intervals
    (-inf, a) and (b, inf); this set of numbers is the complement of the
    previous call's.  If you make the call
 
        GetNumber("", low=a, high=b, low_open=True, high_open=True), the
 
    number returned will be in the open interval (a, b).  If this is
    inverted by setting invert to True as in
 
        GetNumber("", low=a, high=b, low_open=True, 
                  high_open=True, invert=True)
 
    then you'll get a number returned in the union of the half-closed
    intervals (-inf, a] and [b, inf).  A programmer might be confused
    by the fact that the intervals were half-closed, even though the
    settings low_open and high_open were used, implying the programmer
    wanted open intervals.  The way to look at this is to realize that
    if invert is True, it changes an open half-interval to a closed
    half-interval.  I chose to make the function behave this way
    because it's technically correct.  However, if this behavior is
    not to your liking, it's easy to change by changing the
    conditional statements in the conditionals dictionary.  (I debated
    as to whether I should make this function an object instead; then
    this could be done by subclassing rather than changing the
    function.  But the convenience of a simple function won out.)
